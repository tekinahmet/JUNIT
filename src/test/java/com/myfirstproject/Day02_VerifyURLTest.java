/*
QUOTE OF THE DAY:
- Testers do not write a code to PASS
- We write a code to CATCH A BUG

- Our test case failed for this reason. FAIL : Actual URL https://www.amazon.com/ but expected URL is https://amazon.com/
as tester, I shouldn't fix the code to PASS.
STEPS:
-1.  Communicate with the Test Lead, Team Lead, or BA to check if that is a documentation issue.
If it is a documentation issue, BA should fix the AC, and then we should update our script.
-2. If it is an actual bug, then we should communicate with the team to see if a ticket should be raised
or a new story should be created,...
